I implemented TTS and STT in talking with chatbot. What is also attractive about this project is that the bot changes into various animated emoticons depending on the content of the bot's answers, giving the feeling of talking to a real person. In the future, I plan to develop this further and actively respond based on the content of the answer as an actual moving person rather than an emoticon shaped like a bot.",
